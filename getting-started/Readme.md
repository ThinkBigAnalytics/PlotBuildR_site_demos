# Getting Started with plotbuildr Demo

Play with the excerpt from [Gapminder](http://www.gapminder.org/data/) data imported from the \code{gapminder} package. The demo let's you filter by continent, countries and year range. The filtered data is then used to calculate the average life expectency (`'lifeExp'`), population (`'pop'`) and GDP per Capita (`'gdpPercap'`) per country.

Take a look at the aggregated data, try various plots, change x and y axis, edit title etc all without leaving the app.
